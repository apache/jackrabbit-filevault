Configuration
===========

<!-- MACRO{toc} -->

## FileVault Core Bundle

The configuration in this section affects the *FileVault Core Bundle* which is used for all client and server-side features of FileVault. It has a global effect (i.e. is not content packages specific)

### System Properties

The following system properties or OSGi Framework properties can be used 

Property Name | Type | Default Value | Description | Related JIRA Ticket | Supported since
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
`vault.useNioArchive` | `Boolean` | `false` | If set to `true `uses an [Archive implementation](https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/blob/master/vault-core/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/vault/fs/io/ZipNioArchive.java) based on the [Java NIO Zip File System Provider](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/io/fsp/zipfilesystemprovider.html) instead of the [default implementation](https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/blob/master/vault-core/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/vault/fs/io/ZipArchive.java) which is based on [java.util.jar](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/jar/package-summary.html). | [JCRVLT-533](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCRVLT-533) | 3.5.4
`vault.enableStackTraces` | `Boolean` | `false` | If set to `true` persists a stack trace for every opened Archive and logs it in case it was not properly closed. Should only be enabled on non-production environments as this has a negative performance impact. | [JCRVLT-591](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCRVLT-591) | 3.5.10


### OSGi Configuration

If running inside an OSGi container further aspects can be configured with the OSGi metatype for PID `org.apache.jackrabbit.vault.packaging.impl.PackagingImpl`.

## FileVault Filesystem Configuration

The FileVault Filesystem Configuration can be adjusted with a `META-INF/vault/config.xml` file in content packages or in the [Vault CLI](usage.html).

It allows to tweak aggregation settings of the [Vault FS](vaultfs.html). The default config is at <https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/blob/trunk/vault-core/src/main/resources/org/apache/jackrabbit/vault/fs/config/defaultConfig-1.1.xml>. The alternative default config at <https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/blob/trunk/vault-core/src/main/resources/org/apache/jackrabbit/vault/fs/config/defaultConfig-1.1-binaryless.xml> is automatically used once the package property `useBinaryReferences` is set to `true`.

The following XML elements below the root element `vaultfs` are considered. 

### Properties

To exclude binaries from exports you can use the property

```xml
    <properties>
        <!-- configure binary-less serialization -->
        <useBinaryReferences>true</useBinaryReferences>
    </properties>
```

Using this flag leads to binary references being included in the [FileVault DocView XMLs](docview.html).

### Aggregates

Aggregates which influence the serialization during *exports* are configured in `aggregate` child elements having an optional `type` attribute and a `title`.

The following `types` are known: 

Type | Used Class | Description
--- | --- | ---
`file` | `FileAggregator` | Serializes `nt:file` or `nt:resource` nodes into simple files, potentially accompanied by a `.dir` folder containing a `.content.xml` with the metadata.
`filefolder` | `FileFolderAggregator` | Serializes all `nt:hierarchyNode` nodes that have or define a `jcr:content` child node and excludes child nodes that are nt:hierarchyNodes into directories.
`full` | `FullCoverageAggregator` | Serializes full node structures (including all children) into a DocView file named `<nodename>.xml`
`generic` | `GenericAggregator` | the default if no `type` is set, serializes the node and its properties into a `.content.xml` DocView file and the binaries in separate files with extension `.binary`.

Every type except for the first can be restricted via `matches` and `contains` child elements. The former applies a given filter to the current item, while the latter must match ones of the children.
Both contain arbitrarily many `include` or `exclude` nodes. 

Each have either an element `class` for a fully qualified class name or consists of one of the following attributes (which implicitly sets a class)

Filter attribute | Values | Additional attributes | Used Filter Class | Description
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
`nodeType` |  the node type | `respectSupertype` set to `true` means that also all subtypes of the given node type should be considered. | `NodeTypeItemFilter` | Only applies to the given node type.
`isNode` | Either `true` or `false` (the default) | - | `IsNodeFilter` | Only applies to nodes (and not to properties) or vice-versa.
`name` | the qualified name | - |`NameItemFilter` | Only applies to items having the given name
`isMandatory` | Either `true` or `false` (the default) | - | `IsMandatoryFilter` | Only applies to properties/nodes which are marked as (non-)mandatory in the node type definition depending on the given value.

### Handlers (only used for Vault CLI)

Handlers which deserialize nodes from packages during import are registered in `handler` child elements having an optional `type` attribute.

The following `types` are known:

Type | Used Class | Description
--- | --- | ---
`file` | `FileArtifactHandler` | Deserializes `nt:file`s from generic or XML generic serializations
`folder` | `FolderArtifactHandler` | Deserializes folders
`generic` | `GenericArtifactHandler` | Deserializes DocView artifacts, the default if no `type` is set
