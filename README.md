Welcome to Apache Jackrabbit FileVault
===========================================================

The FileVault introduces a JCR repository to filesystem mapping. The mapping
is exposed by an API and used by the "FileVault Content Packages" which allow to
create portable packages of repository content.

The Vault Command Line Interface aka "vlt" provides a subversion like
utility to work and develop with repository content.

Apache Jackrabbit FileVault is a project of the Apache Software Foundation.
