Overview
========

**NOTE**: Parts of the following documentation is outdated and needs review
- - - 

Jackrabbit FileVault introduces a JCR repository to filesystem mapping. The mapping is exposed by an API and used by several tools:

* JackrabbitVaultPackaging that defines a package including the files, configuration and filter information that allows export/import packages of content.
* Vault Command Line Interface aka `vlt` that provides a Subversion like utility to work and develop with repository content.

The base of the Jackrabbit FileVault is the [VaultFs](vaultfs.html) which provides the API for accessing a repository through a filesystem like mapping.

How it works
------------
Jackrabbit FileVault works similar to subversion. Usually you checkout a local copy of the (partial) content of the repository and make modifications to it. Once you're finished you upload the modified stuff again. The content is mapped to a local filesystem structure using the VaultFs API. The mechanism works like Subversion where you have a copy of the unmodified file and some information about the entries.

SCM & FileVault living together
----------------------------------
One of the goals of Jackrabbit FileVault is to provide the ability to store repository content in an SCM for example in Subversion. One problem occurs that the _control files_ of FileVault are not to be added to an SCM since this could cause problem in concurrent development. Those files are kept in the `.vlt` directory which must be excluded from being committed. 

### Subversion

Using the `svn:ignore` property is not advisable because one can forget to define it. A better option is to use the `global-ignores` option in the subversion user configuration:

    ...
    ### Section for configuring miscellaneous Subversion options.
    [miscellany]
    ### Set global-ignores to a set of whitespace-delimited globs
    ### which Subversion will ignore in its 'status' output, and
    ### while importing or adding files and directories.
    global-ignores = .vlt
    
    ...
### Use Cases
The following workflows illustrate that the FileVault/Subversion coupling works and could easily be automated. Plans are to propagate additions and removals automatically using javahl or a similar java-svn binding.

Imagine the following scenario:

* The application XYZ has some repository content that is exported and stored in subversion
* User A and B both have a local checkout
* User A and B work with local test repositories


**Workflow 1 - Modification:**

1. User A does a fix in a jsp, checks it into his local repository and tests if the fix works
2. User A commits the jsp into subversion
3. User B update this copy via subversion and gets the modifications of the jsp
4. User B can now checkin the modifications to his local repository

**Workflow 2 - Addition:**

1. User A creates a new file on his local filesystem
2. User A uses `vlt` to add and commit it to his local repository
3. User A also adds the file to his subversion working copy and commits it
4. User B updates subversion and gets the new file
5. User B updates vault and notifies that this new file is not added to the vault yet
6. User B adds the file as well to his vault and commits it to the repository.

**Workflow 3 - Deletion:**

1. User A deletes a file using `vlt`. This marks the file as deleted and removes it from disk
2. User A commits the changes to his local repository
3. User A marks the file as deleted using =svn= and commits the changes
4. User B updates subversion which deletes his local copy
5. User B marks the file as deleted using `vlt` and commits the changes to his local repository

Export/Checkout directory structure
-----------------------------------
The root directory of a FileVault checkout contains a `META-INF/vault` directory which holds the serialization configuration (`config.xml`) the filter information (`filter.xml`) and other settings. The repository content is placed in a directory named `jcr_root`. eg:

    + mycheckeout
      + META-INF
      + jcr_root

All metadata below META-INF is described in [Metadata](metadata.html).

### User specific config files 
Some configuration files are stored in the user's home directory. usually under `~/.vault`.

1. `~/.vault/settings.xml` - Holds some per user configuration like globally ignored files, etc.
1. `~/.vault/auth.xml` - Holds authorization information for known repositories.

Usage
-----
The console tool is called `vlt` and has the following usage:

    $vlt --help
