========

The FileVault introduces a JCR repository to filesystem mapping. The mapping is exposed by an API and used by the "FileVault Content Packages" which allow to create portable packages of repository content. The Vault Command Line Interface aka "vlt" provides a subversion like utility to work and develop with repository content.
